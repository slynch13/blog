![Moving](/images/image001.png)

I recently decided to move my blog away from WordPress to a static site.

I have been working on learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) so I decided to go with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as my site generator. I had looked at V1 of Gatsby before, and liked it but never really had a project to work on it with.

In the next couple of posts I will talk about what was involved in moving to it and where I ended up hosting it.
