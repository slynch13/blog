When I first decided to move from Wordpress, which I was hosting on [WPEngine](www.wpengine.com). I really liked WPEngine, but do not have the traffic to justify the price. Plus I am liking using Gatsby. 

In the end I decided to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host the static files for the site. I have heard many good things about it on the [Sytax](http://syntax.fm) podcast, and it was really easy to setup.

Next up I plan on adding comments back in using the same approach that [Phyl Haack](https://haacked.com) wrote about in this post https://haacked.com/archive/2018/06/24/comments-for-jekyll-blogs/ .
