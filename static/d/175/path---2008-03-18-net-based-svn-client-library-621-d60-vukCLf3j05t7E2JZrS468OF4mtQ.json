I just have not been able to find a pure .Net client library. It is also seems rare for a source control library to work without a working folder, which is somewhat limiting when I want to check the propagation of examples using this method on the same machine.</p>\n<p>Though I think it would be interesting to write a LINQ to Source provider, as a way to learn expression trees better. Plus it would be nice to be able to not only easily switch hosting providers (the reason I am looking for a pure .Net library) but also to have a standard syntax to allow me to easily switch from SVN to <a href=\"http://sourcegear.com/vault/index.html\">SourceGearâ€™s Vault</a> (which I use for my personal development projects) to TFS (which we use at work) as the storage system for the examples.</p>\n<p>Though <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/SvnBridge\">SvnBridge</a> could possibly help with that too.</p>\n<div class=\"wlWriterSmartContent\" id=\"scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:b1c1d208-8688-4361-be36-f0dbfa4721fb\" style=\"padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px\">\n  Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SVN\" rel=\"tag\">SVN</a>,<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Vault\" rel=\"tag\">Vault</a>,<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/.Net\" rel=\"tag\">.Net</a>,<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/LINQ\" rel=\"tag\">LINQ</a>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://seanlynch.io/aggbug/55.aspx\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n<p><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":".Net based SVN client library","date":"March 18, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008-03-18-net-based-svn-client-library/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2008-03-18-got-my-nice-urls-working/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Got my nice Urls working"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2008-03-18-login-via-usercontrol-view-jquery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Login via Usercontrol View + jQuery"}}}}
