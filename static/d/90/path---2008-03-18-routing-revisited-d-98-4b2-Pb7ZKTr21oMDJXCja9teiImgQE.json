{"data":{"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Starter Blog","author":"Kyle Mathews"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"afe59583-f439-5f9d-99b6-af440a3121f3","html":"<p>It turned out to be a lot easier to work around not being able to <a href=\"http://myheadsexploding.com/archive/2007/12/12/initial-thoughts-on-microsoft-mvc.aspx\">override the route parsing method</a> then I had thought it would be last night. Though when they allow me to override that method I will be changing over.</p>\n<p>By setting up the following routes I was able to get almost the effect that I was looking for:</p>\n<pre class=\"code\"><span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">RouteTable</span>.Routes.Add(<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">new</span> <span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">Route\n</span>{\n    Url = <span style=\"color: #a31515;\">\"Example/[id]/[action]\"</span>,\n    Defaults = <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">new</span> { Controller = <span style=\"color: #a31515;\">\"Example\"</span> },\n    RouteHandler = <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">typeof</span>(<span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">MvcRouteHandler</span>)\n});\n\n<span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">RouteTable</span>.Routes.Add(<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">new</span> <span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">Route\n</span>{\n    Url = <span style=\"color: #a31515;\">\"Example/[Category1]/[id]/[action]\"</span>,\n    Defaults = <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">new</span> { Controller = <span style=\"color: #a31515;\">\"Example\"</span> },\n    RouteHandler = <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">typeof</span>(<span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">MvcRouteHandler</span>)\n});\n\n<span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">RouteTable</span>.Routes.Add(<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">new</span> <span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">Route\n</span>{\n    Url = <span style=\"color: #a31515;\">\"Example/[Category1]/[Category2]/[id]/[action]\"</span>,\n    Defaults = <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">new</span> { Controller = <span style=\"color: #a31515;\">\"Example\"</span> },\n    RouteHandler = <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">typeof</span>(<span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">MvcRouteHandler</span>)\n});</pre>\n<p>Though the execute action just takes the id in</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">[<span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">ControllerAction</span>]\n<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">public</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">void</span> Execute(<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">string</span> id)\n</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If I find that I actually need access to the Categories found in the path, I can access them using RouteData.Values. It also helps that I had decided that the examples should have a unique ID, that will be a lot like the friendly Urls used in <a href=\"http://subtextproject.com\">Subtext</a>. That way the directories are there more for aesthetics then utility. Though when the ability to override the route parsing, I will probably be changing it to this if possible later:</p>\n<p>[<span style=\"color: #2b91af;\">ControllerAction</span>]</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">public</span> <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">void</span> Execute(<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">string</span> id, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">string</span>[] categories)</p>\n<p>So now that I have the site navigation working the way that I want it, with the exception of a helper method for writing out the longer category listings, its time to work on the maintenance parts of the site.</p>\n<p>And so far it seems that this will be a better fit then WebForms was for the last few reworks of the site, since I can make the UserControls containing the examples completely isolated, including having the runat server form in the control. The only one I liked better was the JSON based one, using ASP.Net AJAX Extensions, which would have gone live if AdSense worked with AJAX/JSON sites.</p>\n<p>Overall the more I use it the more I like the feel of the framework. Especially now that I realized which of these  I wanted to selected when using a master page.</p>\n<p>And so far the best part of the framework is that I don’t have to ignore features to not see this dialog after refreshing the page I just navigated to.</p>\n<div id=\"scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:397fa6d3-28ca-4423-8bdc-fba968814994\" class=\"wlWriterSmartContent\" style=\"display: inline; float: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">\n  Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/aspnetmvc\" rel=\"tag\">aspnetmvc</a>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://seanlynch.io/aggbug/41.aspx\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n<p><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Routing revisited","date":"March 18, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008-03-18-routing-revisited/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2008-03-18-a-few-simple-mvc-control-suggestions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A few simple MVC control suggestions"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2008-03-18-generic-beginend-html-tag-extension-method/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Generic begin/end Html tag extension method"}}}}
