For the most part it went pretty smoothly, and learned something about working with a different team too ;). I Implemented an HttpModule that looked for FormsAuthentication redirects for rss feeds and changed it over to use basic authentication so rss readers could authenticate. </p>\n<p>And for a while all was good. In fact other then unit tests I had thought I was done.</p>\n<p>Then just to be thorough I set up several subfolder blogs off of localhost, and everything stopped working. <strike>Apparently something in the way that the rss HttpHandlers in Subtext are called skips all of the HttpModules set up in the web.config. I have a fix for this, I loop through all of the modules in the application and initialize them.</strike> I dont think this is the right solution since it also stops the <authorization> section in the /Admin folder is not being looked at either.</p>\n<div class=\"wlWriterSmartContent\" id=\"0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:01cacb3c-28f7-490c-8e55-25f9e502758e\" contenteditable=\"false\" style=\"PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; DISPLAY: inline; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px\">\n  Technorati Tags: <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/HttpHandler\">HttpHandler</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/HttpModule\">HttpModule</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Subtext\">Subtext</a>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://seanlynch.io/aggbug/33.aspx\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n<p><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"HttpHandlers and directory authentication/HttpModules","date":"September 19, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007-09-19-httphandlers-and-directory-authenticationhttpmodules/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007-09-19-subtext-admin-rss-feeds/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Subtext Admin Rss Feeds"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007-12-11-linq-anonymous-types-and-interfaces-revisited/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"LINQ, Anonymous Types and Interfaces Revisited"}}}}
