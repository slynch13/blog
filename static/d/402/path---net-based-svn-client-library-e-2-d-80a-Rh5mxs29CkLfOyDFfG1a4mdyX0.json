I just have not been able to find a pure .Net client library. It is also seems rare for a source control library to work without a working folder, which is somewhat limiting when I want to check the propagation of examples using this method on the same machine.</p>\n<p>Though I think it would be interesting to write a LINQ to Source provider, as a way to learn expression trees better. Plus it would be nice to be able to not only easily switch hosting providers (the reason I am looking for a pure .Net library) but also to have a standard syntax to allow me to easily switch from SVN to <a href=\"http://sourcegear.com/vault/index.html\">SourceGearâ€™s Vault</a> (which I use for my personal development projects) to TFS (which we use at work) as the storage system for the examples.</p>\n<p>Though <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/SvnBridge\">SvnBridge</a> could possibly help with that too.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":".Net based SVN client library","date":"March 18, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/net-based-svn-client-library/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/got-my-nice-urls-working/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Got my nice Urls working"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/login-via-usercontrol-view-jquery/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Login via Usercontrol View + jQuery"}}}}
