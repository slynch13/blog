Writing Classic ASP style again is taking a little getting used to again though, the visual preview from the designers made styling the page a lot nicer. </p>\n<p>The lack of control designers also seem like it would hinder having a graphics guy using Expression Web do the UI with MVC based web applications. But I have never worked with a graphics guy on a project that way anyway so I am could be wrong.</p>\n<p>It would also be nice if the method used by the Route class to parse the Url was virtual, so I could subclass it and allow me to parse something like:</p>\n<p>/Example/Simple/Form/MultiPageForm/ShowSource/</p>\n<p>to go to the Examples controller, going into the following controller action</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">[<span style=\"color: rgb(43,145,175)\">ControllerAction</span>]<br /><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,255)\">public</span> <span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,255)\">void</span> ShowSource(<span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,255)\">string</span>[] Categories, <span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,255)\">string</span> ID)\n</pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://11011.net/software/vspaste\"></a></p>\n<p>which would allow me to have a consistent directory scheme for both the ASP.Net examples, along with the Classic ASP examples that are already available.</p>\n<p>I could probably do something like /Example/Simple_Form/MultiPageForm/ and use [Controller]/[Category]/[ID]/[Action] but I would prefer it to get to the controller action pre-parsed.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Initial thoughts on Microsoft MVC","date":"March 18, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/initial-thoughts-on-microsoft-mvc/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/generic-beginend-html-tag-extension-method/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Generic begin/end Html tag extension method"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/got-my-nice-urls-working/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Got my nice Urls working"}}}}
