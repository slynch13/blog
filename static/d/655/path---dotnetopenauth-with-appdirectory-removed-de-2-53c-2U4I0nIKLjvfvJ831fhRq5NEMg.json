In this post I will talk a little about the only issue that I ran into while doing this.</p>\n<p>The root of this issue had to do with how my hosting is setup for sites that have low traffic. I host these sites on winhost which allows for an unlimited number of domain pointers. They also have the URL Rewrite module, so I can rewrite <a href=\"http://webquestbuilder.com/\">http://webquestbuilder.com/</a> to <a href=\"http://webquestbuilder.com/sitedir\">http://webquestbuilder.com/sitedir</a> enabling the site to be moved later when demand requires more horsepower without having to deal with the removal of the sub directory.</p>\n<p>The problem that came from this setup was that DotNetOpenAuth determined that the releam was webquestbuilder.com/sitedir instead of webquestbuilder.com, and returned from openid with to the sitedir/authenticate.  <a href=\"http://blog.nerdbank.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Arnott</a> pointed me in the right direction pretty quick after my tweet. Here is what I ended up with to fix this, it is in 2 parts.</p>\n<p>The first is making the request:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">if (isInSubDir)\n{\nrequest = openid.CreateRequest(Request.Form[&quot;openid_identifier&quot;], new Realm(&quot;http://webquestbuilder.com/&quot;),\nnew Uri(&quot;http://webquestbuilder.com/User/Authenticate/&quot;));\n}\nelse\n{\nrequest = openid.CreateRequest(Request.Form[&quot;openid_identifier&quot;]);\n}</code></p>\n<p>The second part is dealing with the response:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">var isInSubDir = Request.ApplicationPath!=&quot;/&quot;;\nIAuthenticationResponse response;\nif (isInSubDir)\n{\nvar absoluteUri = httpRequest.Url.AbsoluteUri;\nvar rawUrl = httpRequest.RawUrl;\nif(isInSubDir)\n{\nabsoluteUri = absoluteUri.Replace(Request.ApplicationPath, &quot;&quot;);\nrawUrl = rawUrl.Replace(Request.ApplicationPath, &quot;&quot;);\n}\nvar httpRequestInfo = new HttpRequestInfo(httpRequest.HttpMethod, new Uri(absoluteUri), rawUrl, headers, httpRequest.InputStream);\nresponse = openid.GetResponse(httpRequestInfo); �\n}\nelse\n{\nresponse = openid.GetResponse();\n}</code></p>\n<p><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"DotNetOpenAuth with AppDirectory removed","date":"March 02, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/dotnetopenauth-with-appdirectory-removed/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/open-id-with-dotnetopenid/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Open Id with DotNetOpenId"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/migrating-to-wordpress-with-url-rewriting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating to WordPress with URL Rewriting"}}}}
