They really are so much nicer to work with then building up Javascript strings in the CS file of the server control. </p>\n<p>I do have a question about them though. One of the ScriptControls I made uses a webservice to pull data if the service name is set. At the moment I have it dynamically registering an JSON script service based webservice. Unfortunately I have found that this is not an optimal solution since the name of the Javascript object created by the ScriptService changes depending on the namespace and class name of the service. </p>\n<p>I am sure that there is a better way to do this, but I am not exactly certain of it. Any suggestions or links would be appreciated.</p>\n<img src=\"http://seanlynch.io/aggbug/58.aspx\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n<p><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ScriptControl question","date":"July 07, 2008"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008-07-07-scriptcontrol-question/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2008-05-21-lazy-list/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lazy list"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2010-03-02-open-id-with-dotnetopenid/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Open Id with DotNetOpenId"}}}}
