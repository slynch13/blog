Its also nice not seeing Google and Yahoo spidering my blog on 4 different domains (still don’t know how they got 2 of them).</p>\n<p><strong>How To Use</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Blog edit screen has a list all the domain aliases, and a button to add a new alias.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If an alias is found, redirects request to the associated blog.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aliases can be at both the host and subfolder level.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Requests are validated against blogs first, so if there is only one blog with a give host name then subfolder aliases would not work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Lessons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.wekeroad.com/\">Rob Conery</a> is for the most part right <a href=\"http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/09/04/in-which-we-discuss-digital-gearheads-and-geek-mastery/\">about the provider model</a>. Having both a data provider and an object provider with wrapper objects over that on top of that seemed to be a little overkill. But even so, figuring out where to put the changes was one of the more enjoyable parts of the change, which was paid for when I implemented the change. I also learned that it is better then the way we do it at work (think really big Page_Load functions).</li>\n<li>I still don’t care much post backs, especially after a pseudo-AJAX/JavaScript framework at work since .Net 1.0. They aren’t as bad as I remembered them being, but the refresh popup when navigating is annoying.</li>\n<li>Seeing a message appear in my email about the build being broken within 30 minutes of committing is somewhat disheartening.
