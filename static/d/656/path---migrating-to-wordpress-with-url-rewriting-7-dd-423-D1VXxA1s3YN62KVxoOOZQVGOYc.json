{"data":{"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Starter Blog","author":"Kyle Mathews"}},"markdownRemark":{"id":"513c60d2-816f-59b2-8321-697f2aafcd72","html":"<p>Recently I switched from using <a title=\"SubText\" href=\"http://subtextproject.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SubText</a> to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"WordPress\" href=\"http://wordpress.org\" rel=\"homepage\">WordPress</a> as my blog engine. The reason for the switch was to get access to all of the plug ins available, I could have added the functionality, but unfortunately I find myself a bit time starved as of late.</p>\n<p>In order to prevent all of my old permalinks links from breaking, while moving from a /year/month/day/postname format to simply having postname as the url, I am using IIS7’s URL Rewriting Module. It turned out to be quite simple to do this, and here are the entries that change the requests to the new Url Scheme:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;rule name=&quot;Aspx&quot; enabled=&quot;false&quot; stopProcessing=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;match url=&quot;archive/[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]/[0-9][0-9]/[0-9][0-9]/([A-Za-z0-9-_.]+).aspx&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;conditions logicalGrouping=&quot;MatchAny&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;action type=&quot;Redirect&quot; url=&quot;http://seanlynch.io/{R:1}&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;/rule&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;rule name=&quot;Rss&quot; enabled=&quot;false&quot; stopProcessing=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;match url=&quot;rss.aspx&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;conditions logicalGrouping=&quot;MatchAny&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;action type=&quot;Redirect&quot; url=&quot;/feed&quot; redirectType=&quot;Permanent&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;/rule&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</code> </p>\n<p>This has been working well, the only issue that I have run into so far is that categories in subtext were marked with numbers by default, and google’s crawler is finding them as broken links. I haven’t decided how to handle these links yet.</p> </p>\n</a>\n<p><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating to WordPress with URL Rewriting","date":"March 13, 2010"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/migrating-to-wordpress-with-url-rewriting/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/dotnetopenauth-with-appdirectory-removed/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"DotNetOpenAuth with AppDirectory removed"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/getting-imports-working-with-dotless-and-cssbundles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting imports working with dotless and CssBundles"}}}}
