I know I can create this with <a href=\"http://www.subsonicproject.com\">Subsonic</a> or another  DAL generator, but currently they aren’t on the list of tech I want to learn at the moment.</p>\n<p>And while this did work, I ran into an error in the dbmI designer when I clicked “View Code” from the context menu:</p>\n<p>This seems to happen when the project has a default namespace assigned to it or possibly having an Entity Namespace set, since I have both. I haven’t looked to much into it since VS puts the partial class definition that it goes to in the cs file of the same name as the dbml file, so I doubt I will be using the view code much anyway.</p>\n<div id=\"scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:3c51c23d-77b1-403c-b4e2-4e7dffe1cf13\" class=\"wlWriterSmartContent\" style=\"display: inline; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">\n  Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/LINQ\" rel=\"tag\">LINQ</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Anonymous%20Types\" rel=\"tag\">Anonymous Types</a>, <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/interface\" rel=\"tag\">interface</a>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://seanlynch.io/aggbug/38.aspx\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\n<p><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span><span class=\"tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0\"></span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"LINQ, Anonymous Types and Interfaces Revisited","date":"December 11, 2007"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2007-12-11-linq-anonymous-types-and-interfaces-revisited/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007-09-16-httphandlers-and-web-config-settings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"HttpHandlers and web.config settings"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}}}}
